# StellarCycle: Space Debris Classification System
Project Description
StellarCycle is an AI-powered system designed to classify space debris into recyclable and non-recyclable categories, paving the way for sustainable space operations. Utilizing a deep learning model trained on spectrometric and visual data, the project integrates a user-friendly Flask-based UI for real-time image analysis.

With its ability to distinguish between recyclable materials such as metals and polymers, and non-recyclable debris, StellarCycle aims to aid space agencies in optimizing debris management and reducing environmental hazards. The project serves as a stepping stone toward building a circular economy in space.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Powered by ResNet18 for high-accuracy classification.
Dataset Handling: Custom scripts for train-validation-test splitting of images.
Web-Based Interface: Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean and intuitive design.
Real-Time Predictions: Upload images to instantly determine whether the material is recyclable.
Visualization: Includes loss and accuracy curves for performance tracking.
Impact
StellarCycle contributes to sustainable space exploration by providing an efficient and user-friendly tool to manage and repurpose space debris. It aligns with global efforts to reduce the growing challenge of orbital debris and promotes resource conservation in extraterrestrial environments.
